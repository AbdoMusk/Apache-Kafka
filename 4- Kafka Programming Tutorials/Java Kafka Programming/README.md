In this section, we'll use Java programming language to programmatically replicate what we were able to achieve with Kafka CLI.

**The following tutorials are recommended:**

*   Creating a Kafka Project base with (whichever you prefer):
    
    *   [Maven](/kafka/creating-a-kafka-java-project-using-maven-pom-xml/)
        
    *   [Gradle](/kafka/creating-a-kafka-java-project-using-gradle-build-gradle/)
        
*   [Complete Kafka Producer](https://github.com/AbdoMusk/Apache-Kafka/blob/main/4-%20Kafka%20Programming%20Tutorials/Java%20Kafka%20Programming/3-%20Complete%20Kafka%20Producer%20with%20Java.md)
    
*   [Complete Kafka Consumer](https://github.com/AbdoMusk/Apache-Kafka/blob/main/4-%20Kafka%20Programming%20Tutorials/Java%20Kafka%20Programming/4-%20Complete%20Kafka%20Consumer%20with%20Java.md)
