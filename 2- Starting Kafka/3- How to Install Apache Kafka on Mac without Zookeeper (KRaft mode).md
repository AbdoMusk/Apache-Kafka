openjdk version "11.0.10" 2021-01-19 LTS
OpenJDK Runtime Environment Corretto-11.0.10.9.1 (build 11.0.10+9-LTS)
OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM Corretto-11.0.10.9.1 (build 11.0.10+9-LTS, mixed mode)shell

### Install Apache Kafka

[](#Install-Apache-Kafka-1)

Download the latest version of Apache Kafka from [https://kafka.apache.org/downloads](https://kafka.apache.org/downloads) under Binary downloads.

![The download page for Apache Kafka where you can download and install Kafka.](../static/images/image__29_.webp "Install Kafka - Apache Kafka Download")

2\. Click on any of the binary downloads (it is preferred to choose the most recent Scala version - example 2.13). For this illustration, we will assume version `2.13-2.8.1`.

3\. Download and extract the contents (double click in the Finder) to a directory of your choice, for example `~/kafka_2.13-2.8.1` .

4\. Navigate to the root of the Apache Kafka folder and open a Terminal. Or Open a Terminal and navigate to the root directory of Apache Kafka. For this example, we will assume that the Kafka download is expanded into the `~/kafka_2.13-2.8.1` directory.

### Start Kafka

[](#Start-Kafka-2)

The first step is to generate a new ID for your cluster

```
~/kafka_2.13-2.8.1/bin/kafka-storage.sh random-uuid
```

This returns a UUID, for example `76BLQI7sT_ql1mBfKsOk9Q`

Next, format your storage directory (replace <uuid> by your UUID obtained above)

```
~/kafka_2.13-2.8.1/bin/kafka-storage.sh format -t <uuid> -c ~/kafka_2.13-2.8.1/config/kraft/server.properties
```

This will format the directory that is in the `log.dirs` in the `config/kraft/server.properties` file (by default `/tmp/kraft-combined-logs`)

Now you can launch the broker itself in daemon mode by running this command.

```
~/kafka_2.13-2.8.1/bin/kafka-server-start.sh ~/kafka_2.13-2.8.1/config/kraft/server.properties
```

Don’t close this terminal window as it will shutdown the broker.

**Congratulations, the broker is now running on its own in KRaft mode!**

### Setup the $PATH environment variable

[](#Setup-the-$PATH-environment-variable-3)

In order to easily access the Kafka binaries, you can edit your PATH variable by adding the following line (edit the content to your system) to your system run commands (for example `~/.zshrc` if you use zshrc):

`PATH="$PATH:/Users/stephanemaarek/kafka_2.13-2.8.1/bin"`

This ensures that you can now run the kafka commands without prefixing them.

After reloading your terminal, the following should work from any directory

```
kafka-topics.sh
```
