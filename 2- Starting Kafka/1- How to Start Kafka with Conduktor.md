How to Start Kafka with Conduktor?
==================================

Create Kafka clusters in seconds

* * *

Getting started with Kafka can be really painful, and you need a cluster to start working. This cluster can be difficult to start, especially on Windows. At the end of the day, getting started with Kafka can be irritating. And we know it, we were there first.

To help you get started quickly, you can start a Kafka cluster directly from our Desktop solution (see below) or you can use our Docker solution to [start Conduktor](https://signup.conduktor.io/get-started/) which will also start a Kafka without doing anything!

Installing Kafka Binaries
-------------------------

Launching Kafka using Conduktor allows you to start Kafka with no requirements, but if you would like to use the CLI tools, you currently need to install the Kafka binaries. Instructions are here (download Kafka and set up the $PATH variable and you're good to go):
